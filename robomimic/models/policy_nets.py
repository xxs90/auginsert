"""
Contains torch Modules for policy networks. These networks take an
observation dictionary as input (and possibly additional conditioning,
such as subgoal or goal dictionaries) and produce action predictions,
samples, or distributions as outputs. Note that actions
are assumed to lie in [-1, 1], and most networks will have a final
tanh activation to help ensure this range.
